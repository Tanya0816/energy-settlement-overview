# Problem Statement

Organizations with distributed energy generation — such as university campuses,
industrial parks, hospitals, and multi-entity facilities — increasingly produce
energy from renewable sources like solar installations.

While energy generation has become more decentralized, the processes used to
reconcile, settle, and audit energy usage have largely remained manual.

## Energy Reconciliation in Practice

In many organizations, energy reconciliation involves:

- collecting monthly meter readings from multiple entities
- calculating energy generated versus energy consumed
- determining surplus and deficit across departments or units
- preparing settlement statements for internal accounting

These steps are often handled using spreadsheets, emails, and manual reviews.

## Where the Friction Occurs

Several challenges commonly arise during and after reconciliation:

### 1. Manual and Time-Consuming Processes
Energy managers and finance teams spend significant time validating data,
cross-checking numbers, and preparing settlement summaries.

As the number of entities grows, the effort increases non-linearly.

---

### 2. Lack of Clear Finalization
In many cases, there is no explicit point at which a settlement is considered
“final.”

Data may be adjusted days or weeks later due to corrections, disputes,
or reporting changes, making it difficult to determine which version
was authoritative at a given time.

---

### 3. Audit and Compliance Challenges
During audits or internal reviews, teams may be asked:

- When was this settlement finalized?
- Were these numbers changed later?
- How can we prove the data was not altered?

Answering these questions often relies on trust, manual logs, or
informal explanations rather than verifiable evidence.

---

### 4. Trust Gaps Between Stakeholders
Energy managers, finance teams, and auditors often rely on different
copies of the same data.

Without a shared mechanism for verification, disagreements can arise
over which version of a settlement is correct.

---

## Why This Matters

Energy settlements are not just operational calculations — they are
financial records.

Inaccurate or unverifiable settlements can lead to:
- audit disputes
- delayed reporting
- loss of internal trust
- hesitation to adopt more advanced energy-sharing models

Before organizations can confidently explore surplus energy sharing
or inter-business energy exchange, these foundational issues must be addressed.
