# Roadmap and Direction

This roadmap outlines how the current pilot MVP connects to the
long-term vision of enabling surplus energy exchange between businesses.

The roadmap emphasizes sequencing and validation rather than speed
or feature breadth.

## Current Stage: Pilot MVP (Completed)

The current pilot focuses on establishing a reliable foundation
for energy settlement and audit integrity.

Capabilities at this stage:
- deterministic monthly energy settlement
- explicit settlement finalization
- cryptographic tamper detection
- finance-readable settlement output

The goal of this stage is **validation**, not scale.

---

## Near-Term Next Step: Pilot Validation

Before expanding scope, the next step is to validate the MVP in
real-world pilot environments such as:
- university campuses
- industrial parks
- multi-entity facilities

Validation goals include:
- confirming settlement workflows align with operational reality
- understanding audit and compliance expectations
- identifying trust gaps between stakeholders
- determining where integrity guarantees are most valuable

No major feature expansion is planned before this feedback is obtained.

---

## Phase 2: Settlement Expansion (Post-Validation)

If pilot validation is successful, the next phase focuses on
enhancing settlement robustness.

Potential additions include:
- multi-period settlement history
- settlement locking and versioning
- role separation (energy, finance, audit)
- improved reporting and export formats

These features strengthen settlement reliability
without introducing market complexity.

---

## Phase 3: Enabling Surplus Energy Exchange

With trusted settlement infrastructure in place,
the system can evolve toward enabling surplus energy exchange
between businesses.

This phase may include:
- pricing rules for surplus energy
- inter-entity credit and debit accounting
- contract-based energy sharing agreements
- compliance-aware exchange workflows

This phase depends on:
- regulatory considerations
- pilot feedback
- organizational readiness

---

## Intentionally Out of Scope (For Now)

The following are explicitly deferred:
- real-time energy markets
- token-based incentives
- automated payments
- consumer-facing trading interfaces

Deferring these elements reduces risk and ensures
that foundational trust mechanisms are established first.

---

## Guiding Principle

The roadmap follows a simple principle:

> **Energy exchange should only be built on top of trusted settlement.**

By sequencing development in this way, the system avoids
premature complexity and aligns with real-world
finance and compliance requirements.
